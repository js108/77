This is a ruby script that takes a thread from the http://www.ilxor.com message board and turns it into a blog lol. 

An example of this high tech approach can be found when we use it to turn [this thread](http://www.ilxor.com/ILX/ThreadSelectedControllerServlet?boardid=40&threadid=105715) in [this blog](http://scoopsnoodle.com/77/).

Ilxor posts by the thread starter with underlines will be a new post, and posts without them will be comments, see [this thread](http://www.ilxor.com/ILX/ThreadSelectedControllerServlet?boardid=40&threadid=105715) for an example.

Alls you have to do to prep the script is insert the url into line 9 and put a username and subtitle in lines 5 and 6. Then you can put it on a server and run a cron job or whatever.
